This data is sourced from [Identifying Medical Diagnoses and Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5).

If you download their data, it includes this chest xray data, plus two folders for optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of the retina, and for code to work with both images sets.

For COVID-19, we clearly do not need the OCT images. Hence I have uploaded the chest-xray data only.

As far as I can tell, this data is identical to [Paul Mooney's Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia). Kaggle says that dataset is 1GB.
